//User story: As a listener, I want to have a set of standard music controls so that I have complete control over my listening experience.

//Acceptance criteria:

//Regardless of scroll position, I see a "player bar" with controls for Play/Pause,
//Previous Track, Next Track, Seek, and Volume.
//The Play/Pause button shows a "play" icon if no song is playing.
//The Play/Pause button shows a "pause" button if a song is playing.
//The Previous Track and Next Track buttons only respond when a song is playing.
//The Previous Track button plays the previous song on the album.
//The Previous Track button doesn't respond if there is no previous song.
//The Next Track button plays the next song on the album.
//The Next Track button doesn't respond if there is no next song.
//I see a slider that shows the current time position of the song.
//I can click and drag on the time control slider to change the current song position.
//I see a slider that shows the player's current volume.
//I can click and drag the volume slider to adjust the volume.
